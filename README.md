# WyzwanieApp

## My first App. 

I would like to present electronic grades register. 

* You can add your student's (or employee's) name and add grades. 
* Grades are similar (not the same) to grading scale used in Polish school. That means the grades can be as follows:
  1, +1, -2, 2, -3, 3, +3, -4, 4, +4, -5, 5, +5, -6, 6 (from the lowest to the highest grade).
* There are also informations (statistics) such as: The highest grade. The Lowest grade. The average of the grades you added.
* If you want to quit the program, just press "q" and conform selection by pressing ENTER.
